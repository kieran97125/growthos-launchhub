# LaunchHub

LaunchHub is the Campaign Launch & Lead Capture OS product slice inside Growth OS. It is an attribution-ready campaign form, Wix embed, landing page, UTM capture and source snapshot layer.

It is designed for multi-brand campaign operations as:

- A Wix-embeddable registration form system.
- A parent-page UTM and click ID capture layer.
- A source snapshot system that stays separate from mutable lead/outcome data.
- A CTWA / WhatsApp attribution boundary for a future separate CRM.
- A booking, payment, show/no-show, lost, and follow-up feedback loop for future revenue attribution.

## Naming Direction

- Internal product/system name: LaunchHub.
- Descriptive name: Campaign Launch & Lead Capture OS.
- Public campaign pages and public forms should show the selected brand and operating company, not the system name.
- Alyssa, Ineffable, Skin Light, and future names remain brand records or campaign clients inside the system.
- Do not use public customer-facing pages to define developer/company IP ownership. System IP, ownership, and company licence terms should be handled by a separate written agreement between the developer and the company.

## Architecture Boundary

LaunchHub owns the lead capture and source attribution layer. It is responsible for Wix-embeddable registration forms, parent-page UTM and click ID capture, public lead submission, immutable `lead_source_snapshots`, lead event logging, thank-you tracking, and attribution-ready dashboard views.

LaunchHub is not the future CRM app. The future CRM app should be a separate WhatsApp-first CRM for Meta WhatsApp API integration, WhatsApp inbox handling, CS follow-up, AI reply assistance, booking confirmation, paid / show / no-show / lost outcome tracking, and outcome write-back.

Both apps must share the same base data model. The shared base concepts are:

- `contacts`
- `leads`
- `lead_source_snapshots`
- `lead_events`
- `bookings`
- `brands`
- `treatments`
- `packages`
- `branches`

The contract is that LaunchHub creates the first attribution-backed lead record and source snapshot when a customer arrives from Wix, a form, CTWA, or another captured source. The future CRM reads the same `contacts`, `leads`, `lead_source_snapshots`, and `bookings` records, then writes operational outcomes back through `bookings`, `leads`, and `lead_events`. This lets the dashboard later calculate source-to-booking, source-to-show, and source-to-paid conversion without treating the CRM as a separate data island.

## Project Status

- Local app ready.
- GitHub ready.
- Vercel preview ready.
- Supabase-backed lead insert tested locally and on Vercel production.
- Real lead insert path ready.
- Wix embed production test pending.
- Payment webhook authentication pending.
- WhatsApp webhook authentication pending.

## Product Modes

LaunchHub supports two output modes that share the same lead capture, UTM, source snapshot, booking, and event model.

### Form-only mode

- The user configures brand, treatment, package, branch, and form token.
- The system generates an embed script.
- The embed script is inserted into Wix pages.
- Wix remains the main website and brand website.
- LaunchHub handles form capture, UTM capture, source snapshots, lead attribution, bookings, and lead events.

### Landing page mode

- The same form config can be wrapped in a simple campaign landing page when a campaign needs hero copy, offer sections, treatment content, CTA copy, FAQ, testimonials, or visual assets.
- Landing pages are for fast market testing and campaign experiments.
- Landing page mode is not a full Wix replacement.
- It remains a campaign testing layer backed by the same lead attribution model.
- The current implementation uses local seed config for `landing_pages`; a future builder can persist fields such as `hero_title`, `hero_subtitle`, `hero_image_url`, `offer_badge`, `cta_text`, and `sections_json`.

Future CRM connection remains separate. The future CRM app should read and write outcomes against the shared lead base instead of becoming part of the LaunchHub UI.

## Configuration Layer Direction

Configuration Foundation V1 introduces a clear hierarchy for campaign testing:

```text
Brand
↓
Treatment
↓
Package / Price
↓
Branch
↓
Form
↓
Form-only embed or Landing page mode
```

The current app exposes settings pages for:

- Brand settings.
- Treatment settings.
- Package / price settings.
- Branch settings.
- Landing Page Templates.

Form-only mode uses this configuration layer to select a brand, treatment, package, and branch, then generate the Wix embed script.

Landing page mode uses the same form/source/lead base and adds template, hero copy, offer copy, sections, FAQ, CTA, and visual content for simple campaign testing pages.

## Settings Editor V1

Settings control the options available when creating Campaigns, Wix registration forms, and Landing Pages.

- Brands, treatments, packages, and branches can be added and edited from `/settings`.
- Unused brands, treatments, packages, and branches can be deleted.
- Delete is blocked when a record is already used by forms, landing pages, leads, bookings, or dependent settings.
- There is no archive / inactive / re-enable workflow in V1.
- Lead price still comes from the server-side package configuration selected by `package_id`; public form submissions must not trust client-submitted prices.

Current implementation notes:

- `brands`, `treatments`, `packages`, `branches`, and `forms` are read from existing Supabase tables when configured, with local config as a fallback for development.
- Landing page templates and landing page config remain local config for now.
- Full admin editing for forms, templates, and landing page content remains future work.
- A future DB-backed `landing_pages` table can store template, hero, offer, section, FAQ, CTA, and status fields when the builder graduates from config preview.
- The future WhatsApp CRM remains a separate app that writes outcomes back to the shared lead base.

## Landing Page Content Editor Direction

Landing Page Content Editor V1 is a structured editor foundation for campaign testing pages. It is not a full Wix replacement and not a drag-and-drop page builder.

Current V1 supports an editor-like internal screen for:

- Basic page settings.
- Template selection foundation.
- Hero title, subtitle, and image URL.
- Offer badge, offer copy, and CTA copy.
- Pain points and benefits.
- Treatment / package / branch summary.
- Process, trust cues, and FAQ.
- Form connection and preview URL.
- A live-style preview panel.

The current editor UI is read-only / save-ready by design. Save and publish workflows should be added later with a DB-backed `landing_pages` table for fields such as template, status, slug, hero content, offer content, sections, FAQ, CTA, and publish metadata.

Wix remains the main website. LaunchHub landing pages are for fast offer, angle, treatment, and audience testing while preserving the same lead capture and attribution flow.

## DB-backed Landing Page Builder Direction

The current landing page editor is a config-preview foundation. A future DB-backed builder should store campaign page content and image assets in Supabase before full editing is enabled.

Recommended model:

- `landing_pages` - one record per campaign page, with slug, title, brand, treatment, package, branch, form, template, mode, status, current content, image assets, and published version reference.
- `landing_page_versions` - version history for drafts and published versions.
- `landing_page_templates` - optional template registry if templates become editable instead of local config.
- `landing_page_assets` - optional asset registry once upload/media library exists.

Recommended JSON fields:

- `content_json` - hero, offer, CTA, pain points, benefits, sections, process, trust, and FAQ content.
- `image_assets_json` - hero, mobile hero, offer, treatment, process, and trust image URLs or storage references.

Future workflow:

- Save draft: write a draft version without changing public output.
- Internal preview: allow internal users to preview a draft version.
- Publish: mark a selected version as published, update `published_version_id`, and make `/lp/[slug]` render only published content.
- Archive: remove a campaign page from public rendering without deleting history.

Public `/lp/[slug]` should read only published content. Internal preview routes can read draft content after team access is connected. Images may later come from Supabase Storage, Wix assets, or external URLs. Team access should control who can edit, publish, and archive pages.

Draft SQL direction is documented in:

```text
supabase/drafts/20260614000200_landing_page_builder_foundation.sql
```

## Landing Page Save / Publish V1

Landing Page Save / Publish V1 promotes the builder plan into a real Supabase migration:

```text
supabase/migrations/20260614000200_create_landing_page_builder.sql
```

The migration creates:

- `landing_pages` - one record per campaign page, including slug, title, brand, treatment, package, branch, form, template, mode, status, current content JSON, image asset JSON, published version reference, publish timestamp, and audit timestamps.
- `landing_page_versions` - draft / published version records for page-level content JSON and image asset JSON.

The V1 workflow is intentionally structured rather than drag-and-drop:

- Save draft: writes the current page-level content and image asset JSON into `landing_page_versions` with `status = 'draft'`, then updates the parent `landing_pages` row as draft.
- Publish: submits the current editor form state, checks required brand / treatment / package / branch / form / public copy fields, creates a new published version, updates `landing_pages.status = 'published'`, sets `published_version_id`, and updates `published_at`.
- Public render: `/lp/[slug]` renders the `published_version_id` version only for Supabase landing pages. It does not render draft versions as public campaign content.
- Internal editor: `/landing-pages/[pageId]` shows Save Draft / Publish controls only as DB-backed actions when the migration is applied; otherwise it clearly stays in local config fallback mode.

Apply the migration in Supabase SQL editor or through your migration workflow before expecting Save Draft / Publish to persist. The current editor still uses read-only prefilled fields; full field editing, media upload, version history UI, draft preview URLs, and any future team-based publish permissions remain future builder work.

## Multi-form Management

LaunchHub supports multiple reusable registration forms per brand.

- Forms share one unified visual style in `/embed/[formToken]`.
- Each form has its own `public_form_token` and Wix embed code.
- A form can be embedded directly in Wix or connected to a Landing Page campaign.
- Forms differ by business configuration: brand, treatment, package, branch, allowed domains, and status.
- Creating or duplicating a form generates a new safe token in the format `[brand-slug]-[campaign-or-form-slug]-form-[shortid]`.
- Duplicate form copies configuration only, creates a new form token, and does not copy leads or submissions.
- Unused forms can simply be left unused for now.
- Archive, delete, and re-enable workflows are not part of V1.
- Existing leads remain unchanged when form settings are edited.

This keeps form management flexible without creating per-form style systems or a visual form builder.

## Create Campaign Flow

`/campaigns/new` gives marketers one guided entry point for starting a campaign.

- New ad Landing Page - creates a new form, then creates a draft Landing Page connected to that new form.
- Wix registration form only - creates a new reusable form for Wix embed and redirects to the form detail page.
- Existing form Landing Page - reuses a selected existing form, then creates a new draft Landing Page connected to that form.
- All options use the same lead capture, source tracking, package price, and booking base.
- Landing Page editor can change the connected form later; existing leads are not changed.
- Publishing remains a separate step in the Landing Page editor and publishes the current editor content.

## Landing Page Image Asset Strategy

Landing page mode uses structured image slots so marketers can prepare brand-fit campaign assets for testing. Images should support trust, desire, offer value, and booking confidence without replacing the full Wix website.

Recommended slots:

- `hero_image_url` - desktop hero visual; premium clinic, consultation, or glowing-skin image. Recommended ratio: 16:9 or 4:3.
- `mobile_hero_image_url` - mobile first-screen hero visual. Recommended ratio: 4:5.
- `offer_image_url` - offer value image, treatment room, or device close-up. Recommended ratio: 1:1 or 4:5.
- `treatment_image_url` - product, service, or treatment visual. Recommended ratio: 1:1 or 4:5.
- `process_image_1_url` - consultation / skin analysis. Recommended ratio: 1:1.
- `process_image_2_url` - treatment experience. Recommended ratio: 1:1.
- `process_image_3_url` - WhatsApp booking confirmation. Recommended ratio: 1:1.
- `trust_image_url` - clean clinic, professional environment, or reception visual. Recommended ratio: 16:9.

Current V1 supports image URLs and premium placeholders. Upload, cropping, media library, Supabase Storage, Wix assets, and external image management are future work.

## UI Localization Note

The application UI is localized for Hong Kong internal growth and marketing users in Traditional Chinese / Hong Kong Cantonese where appropriate. Technical identifiers remain in English, including routes, API payload keys, UTM fields, CTWA fields, `source_type`, `tracking_status`, and `audit_reason` values.

## Guided UX Direction

LaunchHub is designed for non-technical marketing, management, CS, and operations users. Business screens should explain what the page is for, what the user should do first, which actions are safe internal actions, and which actions affect public campaign pages.

Core guided workflows:

- Form-only mode - Wix owns the page content; LaunchHub provides the embedded form and attribution capture.
- Landing page mode - marketers prepare campaign content, save internal drafts, preview, then publish a public campaign page.
- Lead monitoring - CS and operations review latest registration records and booking requests.
- Performance reporting - management and marketing compare leads, bookings, source, campaign, treatment, package, and branch performance.
- Future CRM feedback - the future WhatsApp CRM writes outcomes back into the shared lead base.

Technical audit details such as low-level tracking fields, system health, source snapshot diagnostics, and webhook debugging should stay in `/system-audit`, not on the main business screens.

## Design System Direction

LaunchHub internal admin screens use the Growth OS / SmartVolt OS product style rather than a single-brand beauty palette.

Current V1 design tokens define:

- Clean white and slate page surfaces.
- Soft blue gradient accents.
- Dark navy CTA treatment.
- Slate text with blue module cues.
- Premium SaaS cards, rounded radii, focus states, and soft shadows.
- Public campaign pages and embedded forms can still use brand-specific themes.

Shared UI primitives currently live in the legacy `src/components/alyssa/` folder for reusable cards, stats, badges, empty states, CTA buttons, section headers, page shells, and motion reveals. A later cleanup can rename that internal folder without changing product behavior.

Motion is provided by `motion/react` and is used sparingly for subtle section reveal, KPI card reveal, CTA hover/tap, landing page hero reveal, and editor/list card polish. Reduced-motion preferences are respected through `useReducedMotion()` and the global `prefers-reduced-motion` CSS guard.

If the internal app grows into a larger admin surface, shadcn/ui-style primitives are the preferred next component-system step. Open Props-style token thinking may inspire future refinements, but LaunchHub tokens should remain aligned with Growth OS.

## Ineffable Beauty Public Theme

LaunchHub admin and internal business pages remain neutral system screens. Public campaign surfaces can use a selected brand theme without recoloring the backend.

Ineffable Beauty public Landing Pages and public embedded forms use a warm cream / terracotta / coffee palette: cream background, soft beige borders, deep coffee text, and terracotta CTA buttons. Customer-facing copy should use the selected brand name, while the legal/operator footer uses YISSA GROUP LIMITED where an operator entity is shown.

Current implementation uses a safe code fallback theme resolver for `ineffable`, `ineffable-beauty`, and `Ineffable Beauty`. Future brand settings can add database-backed theme fields for palette, CTA tone, background, and public typography.

## Local Setup

```bash
npm install
```

Run the local app on port 3010:

```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3010
```

Open:

- `http://localhost:3010/forms`
- `http://localhost:3010/embed-preview`
- `http://localhost:3010/embed/alyssa-main-form-dev-token`

- `/api/webhooks/whatsapp` - WhatsApp inbound / CTWA attribution webhook placeholder; creates or updates shared contact/source records after authentication is added.

## Internal Access Boundary

LaunchHub separates public campaign/form routes from internal business and configuration routes.

Public routes remain accessible for campaigns, Wix embeds, and lead capture:

- `/lp/[slug]`
- `/embed/[formToken]`
- `/legal/[brandSlug]/[documentType]`
- `/thank-you`
- `/api/public/forms/[token]`
- `/api/public/leads`
- `/api/public/events`
- `/api/public/thank-you`

Internal admin routes are protected by a simple shared LaunchHub admin password:

- `/`
- `/dashboard`
- `/leads`
- `/performance`
- `/campaigns`
- `/campaigns/new`
- `/create-campaign`
- `/forms`
- `/forms/new`
- `/forms/[formId]`
- `/landing-pages`
- `/landing-pages/[pageId]`
- `/settings`
- `/settings/brands`
- `/settings/treatments`
- `/settings/packages`
- `/settings/branches`
- `/settings/templates`
- `/system-audit`
- `/embed-preview`
- `/debug/session`

LaunchHub uses one shared admin password for the current admin backend. There is no username, no roles, no owner/editor/lead_viewer blocking, and no domain-wide cookie. Successful password entry sets a host-only `httpOnly` signed cookie for the current admin host with `sameSite=lax`, `path=/`, secure cookies in production, and an expiry of about 12 hours. `/logout` clears the cookie and redirects to `/login`.

Public landing pages, embedded forms, legal pages, public lead submit APIs, static assets, and the public embed script remain reachable without login.

`app.beautytrialhk.com` should be used for the admin backend. `go.beautytrialhk.com` should be used for public landing pages, embedded forms, and legal pages. The proxy keeps this host separation and only redirects admin paths from the public host back to the admin host.

Required Vercel env vars for the simple admin gate:

- `LAUNCHHUB_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `LAUNCHHUB_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET`

Legacy env vars from the removed internal auth flow are deprecated and not required for deployment:

- `INTERNAL_ACCESS_USERS`
- `INTERNAL_AUTH_SESSION_SECRET`
- `INTERNAL_AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN`
- `INTERNAL_AUTH_DISABLED`
- `INTERNAL_BASIC_AUTH_USER`
- `INTERNAL_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`

Do not commit real credentials. If team login is needed later, add a new Supabase Auth, Google Login, or role-based admin login flow deliberately instead of extending this shared password gate.

## Team Access Direction

The current admin backend uses a simple shared password gate only. The previous Basic Auth / custom role session gate has been removed from the active route path because it caused production navigation failures.

The intended long-term layer is Supabase Auth plus role-based access control. Each team member should have their own login, a profile, a role, a status, and optional brand access.

Team Access Enforcement V1 remains a planning and helper foundation only. Current admin pages do not enforce roles or brand permissions:

- no `owner` / `editor` / `lead_viewer` route blocking
- no per-brand filtering based on a logged-in user
- no user management, invitations, or password reset

This does not mean real login exists yet. It prepares internal pages and navigation to understand the shape of role, module, and brand access before Supabase Auth is connected.

Suggested roles:

- `owner` - full business, settings, audit, and future CRM access.
- `admin` - system administrator for daily internal operations.
- `manager` - management view across leads, performance, campaigns, and future CRM.
- `marketer` - campaign, form, landing page, and performance role.
- `cs` - customer-service role for leads and future WhatsApp CRM follow-up.
- `designer` - landing page and form-content support role.
- `viewer` - read-only overview and performance role.

Suggested modules:

- `dashboard`
- `leads`
- `performance`
- `forms`
- `landing_pages`
- `settings`
- `system_audit`
- `future_crm`

Suggested shared access tables:

- `profiles` - one row per Supabase Auth user, with role and status.
- `user_brand_access` - optional brand-level access for multi-brand growth.
- `user_module_permissions` - optional per-user overrides only if role defaults are not enough.

The future CRM app should reuse this access model where possible, especially `profiles`, roles, status, and brand access. This keeps LaunchHub and CRM from creating separate user islands.

Implemented helper foundation in `src/lib/security/teamAccess.ts`:

- `canAccessModule(role, module)`
- `canAccessBrand(userAccess, brandId)`
- `getRoleLabel(role)`
- `getModuleLabel(module)`
- `getVisibleModulesForRole(role)`
- `getCurrentAccessContext()`
- `getAccessibleBrandIds(userAccess, allBrandIds)`
- `shouldIncludeBrandScopedRecord(userAccess, brandId)`

Future brand-scoped pages should filter:

- Leads by accessible brand IDs.
- Performance data by accessible brand IDs.
- Forms by accessible brand IDs.
- Landing pages by accessible brand IDs.

A draft SQL direction is documented in:

```text
supabase/drafts/20260614000100_team_access_foundation.sql
```

This is intentionally a draft, not an applied migration. Full login, user management, invitations, password reset, and role editing remain future admin work.

## Embed Preview

`/embed-preview` simulates a Wix parent landing page. It loads the real public embed script:

```text
http://localhost:3010/embed/launchhub-form.js
```

The preview page includes:

- A sample campaign landing page offer.
- The real embedded iframe form.
- A sample UTM URL button.
- An internal debug panel showing captured UTM, click ID, visitor/session IDs, tracking status, and audit reason.

## Test UTM Capture

Open this local URL:

```text
http://localhost:3010/embed-preview?utm_source=meta&utm_medium=paid_social&utm_campaign=launchhub_campaign_test&utm_content=offer_card&fbclid=preview_fbclid_123
```

Expected behavior:

- The parent page captures the UTM and click ID before iframe submission.
- The debug panel shows the captured fields.
- The embedded form receives the attribution payload through `postMessage`.
- Submitting the form returns a local no-op lead response until Supabase is configured.

## Test Direct Iframe Form

Open:

```text
http://localhost:3010/embed/alyssa-main-form-dev-token
```

This tests the iframe form itself. It does not simulate parent-page attribution unless the parent embed script sends a payload, so `/embed-preview` is the preferred attribution test.

## Wix Embed Code

In local development, use:

```html
<script
  src="http://localhost:3010/embed/launchhub-form.js"
  data-form-token="alyssa-main-form-dev-token"
  data-brand="alyssa"
  data-form-id="alyssa-main-form">
</script>
```

In production, set:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_BASE_URL=
```

If only `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set, the app uses it for both admin and public URLs. If `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_BASE_URL` is set, public Landing Page / embed links and internal admin links can be separated later without hard-coding a final domain. This prepares a future split such as admin on one domain and public campaign pages on another.

For the Beauty Trial HK domain split, internal admin pages should use the admin host and public campaign pages should use the public host:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_BASE_URL=https://app.beautytrialhk.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://go.beautytrialhk.com
```

Internal navigation uses relative admin paths such as `/dashboard`, `/landing-pages`, `/forms`, and `/settings`. If `/login` or another internal admin route is opened on the public host, the proxy redirects it to the configured admin origin while keeping admin access open.

Public campaign slugs should use the active brand name. The Ineffable $388 campaign canonical URL is `/lp/ineffable-388-488b24`; the older `/lp/alyssa-388-488b24` URL is kept as a redirect/alias so existing ad links can continue to resolve without showing Alyssa branding.

## Public Meta Pixel PageView

Public Landing Pages can fire a Meta Pixel `PageView` event for campaign traffic. This is public-page only and is not loaded on admin pages such as `/dashboard`, `/landing-pages`, `/leads`, `/settings`, or `/system-audit`.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_META_PIXEL_ID=
```

If `NEXT_PUBLIC_META_PIXEL_ID` is not set, no Pixel script is rendered. Lead/CompleteRegistration events are not fired in this pass; they should be added later only after event naming and consent requirements are confirmed.

## Supabase Connection

The app renders locally without Supabase. Public write APIs return local no-op IDs unless these environment variables are configured:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
```

Never expose `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to browser code.

When Supabase is connected, run the migration in:

```text
supabase/migrations/20260612000100_create_alyssa_lead_capture_os.sql
```

The migration creates:

- `contacts`
- `leads`
- `lead_source_snapshots`
- `lead_events`
- `forms`
- `brands`
- `treatments`
- `packages`
- `branches`
- `bookings`
- dashboard source/audit views

## Schema Readiness Audit

The current Supabase migration contains the shared base tables needed by LaunchHub and the future CRM app:

- `contacts` - present; includes `normalized_phone` as the shared customer matching key.
- `leads` - present; stores `normalized_phone`, `source_snapshot_id`, `source_type`, `payment_status`, `booking_status`, `lead_status`, and `crm_status`.
- `lead_source_snapshots` - present; stores UTM, click ID, CTWA, WhatsApp referral, tracking status, and audit fields separately from mutable lead outcomes.
- `lead_events` - present; includes form, attribution, WhatsApp, booking, payment, CRM follow-up, show/no-show, paid, lost, and duplicate events.
- `bookings` - present; links booking state back to lead, contact, brand, treatment, and branch.
- `brands` - present.
- `treatments` - present.
- `packages` - present.
- `branches` - present.

Schema conclusion: the base schema is ready for Supabase migration as a shared lead/source base. No table rename or major schema expansion is needed for this pass. The remaining work is connection, authentication, production domain setup, and live insert testing.

## Future CRM Contract Notes

The future CRM app should follow this contract:

- Match customers by `contacts.normalized_phone`.
- When a form lead already exists, read `leads.source_snapshot_id` and the linked `lead_source_snapshots` row instead of creating a disconnected source record.
- When a WhatsApp conversation arrives with CTWA referral metadata and no matching lead exists, create a shared lead/source path using `source_type = 'whatsapp_ctwa'`.
- When a WhatsApp conversation arrives without reliable source evidence and no matching lead exists, create the lead/source path using `source_type = 'organic_unknown'`.
- Update booking state through the existing `booking_status` values on `bookings` and, where appropriate, the related `leads.booking_status`.
- Log CRM follow-up activity into `lead_events` with `crm_followup_started` and `crm_followup_updated`.
- Write paid / show / no-show / lost outcomes through existing lead status, payment status, booking status, and event values such as `deal_paid`, `show_up`, `no_show`, and `deal_lost`.
- Preserve the original source snapshot so source-to-booking and source-to-paid conversion can be calculated later from `dashboard_lead_source_performance`.

Payment status semantics:

- `booking_only` means the customer requested a booking without starting a payment flow.
- `pending` means a payment flow has started or is awaiting payment confirmation.
- `leads.price` stores the selected package promo/display price; it is not reduced to zero just because `payment_status = 'booking_only'`.

- `PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - pending; must be added before production payment webhook use.
- Legacy internal auth env vars are deprecated and not required: `INTERNAL_ACCESS_USERS`, `INTERNAL_AUTH_SESSION_SECRET`, `INTERNAL_AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN`, and `INTERNAL_AUTH_DISABLED`.
- Future WhatsApp webhook secret / verification token - pending; must be added before production WhatsApp webhook use.

## Future Vercel Deployment

Do not deploy yet. Before deployment:

- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to the final Vercel or custom domain.
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_BASE_URL=https://app.beautytrialhk.com` for internal admin pages and `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://go.beautytrialhk.com` for public campaign pages when using the split domains.
- Configure Supabase environment variables in Vercel.
- Configure `LAUNCHHUB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `LAUNCHHUB_ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` in Vercel.
- Add production Wix domains to `forms.allowed_domains`.
- Confirm webhook authentication for payment and WhatsApp endpoints.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build`.

## Production Trial Checklist

- Configure environment variables in Vercel.
- Keep `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` server-side only.
- Set custom domains later; do not hard-code the final public/admin domains until confirmed.
- Add the public Wix or campaign domain to each form's allowed domains.
- Use Create Campaign to generate either a Wix form or a Landing Page.
- Test a UTM lead submission before running real ads.
- Confirm `/system-audit` shows public form lookup, main form token, and landing page route checks as ready.
- Test records with stamp `50969` currently remain in dev data and should not be deleted until a separate cleanup pass.

## Public Form Legal Consent

All public lead forms require visitors to tick a legal consent checkbox before submitting. The checkbox confirms the visitor has read and agreed to the Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, and Disclaimer, and agrees that submitted data may be used for appointment, customer service, and related follow-up.

- Public legal pages now contain first-pass Traditional Chinese placeholder content for Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, and Disclaimer.
- Company and legal review is required before official launch or larger paid campaign use.
- Current placeholder legal routes are `/legal/alyssa/privacy`, `/legal/alyssa/terms`, and `/legal/alyssa/disclaimer`.
- Replace placeholder legal content with brand-approved legal documents before running larger paid campaigns.
- `/api/public/leads` also validates `legalConsentAccepted` server-side, so consent is not only a browser UI check.
- Consent proof is recorded in `lead_events` using the existing allowed `form_submit_success` event type with `consent_event = "legal_consent_accepted"` in `event_payload_json`.
- Marketing or promotional consent should be added later as a separate optional checkbox. It is intentionally not included in this pass.
- Public Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, and Disclaimer should identify the brand/operator and explain customer data use, offer rules, booking rules, and treatment-effect limitations.
- Public customer-facing terms must not say customer data belongs to the developer, the system belongs to the developer, or source code ownership belongs to the developer.

Future brand legal profile fields to add when settings become editable:

- `operating_company_name`
- `company_registered_name`
- `contact_phone`
- `contact_email`
- `privacy_policy_url`
- `terms_url`
- `disclaimer_url`
- `footer_disclosure`

## Google Sheets Lead Sync V1

LaunchHub can send each successfully created public lead to a Google Apps Script webhook, which can append one Ineffable CS follow-up row into Google Sheets before the full CRM is ready.

Setup:

- Create or choose the Google Sheet for CS follow-up.
- Create a Google Apps Script web app that receives JSON and appends one row to the sheet.
- Validate the submitted `secret` inside Apps Script before writing to the sheet.
- Configure these server-side environment variables:
  - `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SYNC_ENABLED=true`
  - `GOOGLE_SHEETS_SYNC_MODE=apps_script`
  - `GOOGLE_SHEETS_WEBHOOK_URL`
  - `GOOGLE_SHEETS_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

If sync is disabled, required config is missing, or the webhook fails, lead creation still succeeds and the server logs a safe sync skipped warning. The webhook URL and secret must never be exposed to client-side code.

Webhook payload keys:

The webhook body includes `secret` for Apps Script validation plus these row fields:

`createdAt`, `followUpStatus`, `csOwner`, `brand`, `branch`, `customerName`, `phone`, `email`, `treatmentOffer`, `appointmentDate`, `appointmentTime`, `source`, `campaignAd`, `pageUrl`, `note`, `lastFollowUpAt`.

Latest Ineffable CS follow-up sheet columns:

`Created At`, `跟進狀態`, `CS 負責人`, `品牌`, `分店`, `客人姓名`, `電話`, `Email`, `療程 / 優惠`, `預約日期`, `預約時間`, `來源`, `Campaign / 廣告`, `Page URL`, `備註`, `最後跟進時間`.

Default CS fields:

- `跟進狀態` = `待跟進`
- `CS 負責人` = blank
- `備註` = blank
- `最後跟進時間` = blank

The sync runs only after the Supabase lead, source snapshot, booking, and lead event records are created. Invalid submissions, honeypot submissions, missing consent, rate-limited duplicates, and duplicate lead rows do not trigger the webhook. If Google Sheets append fails, public lead submission still returns success and CS can continue using LaunchHub/Supabase as the source of truth.

The CS sheet is intentionally reduced for follow-up work. Raw attribution fields such as click IDs, Meta IDs, CTWA IDs, consent proof, source type, and technical event details remain in LaunchHub/Supabase for marketing attribution and audit use.

For CS readability, the sheet source label is simplified to values such as `Meta`, `Google`, `Organic`, or `直接 / 無追蹤`. This display label does not change stored attribution fields.

CS teammates can manually update `跟進狀態`, `CS 負責人`, `備註`, and `最後跟進時間` in the sheet. The Google Sheet can also support manual WhatsApp ad leads through an Apps Script button or custom menu before the future WhatsApp API webhook integration is ready.

## Public Reliability & Security V1

This pass adds a lightweight public safety layer for small-scale campaign testing.

- Public forms include a hidden honeypot field; if it is filled, the submission is rejected with a friendly user message.
- `/api/public/leads` checks for same form + same normalized phone duplicate submissions within a short window before creating another lead.
- A small IP burst limiter is used when forwarded IP headers are available; phone/form duplicate checking remains the primary DB-backed protection.
- Public submission errors return user-friendly messages while server logs keep concise diagnostics such as reason code, form token, normalized phone, origin, short user agent, and timestamp.
- Public Landing Pages render published content only for normal visitors. Unpublished or missing pages show a clean unavailable state.
- Public embed forms show a clean unavailable state when the token or config cannot be loaded.
- Campaign pages include a compact preflight checklist for public page, form token, allowed domain, test lead, UTM, and price checks before ads.
- Basic response headers include `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` and `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.
- Frame-blocking headers and CSP are intentionally skipped for now so Wix iframe embeds keep working.

This is suitable for early real campaign trials. It is not yet a high-volume enterprise anti-abuse layer, full bot management system, or CRM authentication layer.
